# Decentralization Starts Here

The ThreeFold Grid is more than just a decentralized cloud platform—it’s a vision for a better internet. By empowering anyone to build their own infrastructure, we’re challenging the status quo and creating a system that prioritizes transparency, control, and accessibility. Whether you’re deploying on nodes managed by farmers, running your own hardware, or leveraging cloud providers, the ThreeFold Grid offers a flexible, cost-effective, and scalable solution for modern cloud computing needs.

But this is just the beginning. The ThreeFold Grid thrives on community collaboration, continuous improvement, and a shared commitment to decentralization. With easy onboarding, a vibrant support network, and a transparent development process, we’re building a platform that evolves with the needs of its users.

The future of the internet is in your hands. Whether you’re contributing to the grid, deploying your own nodes, or simply exploring the possibilities, you’re part of a movement that’s redefining how we think about cloud computing. Together, we can create a more open, resilient, and user-centric internet.
