# Collaborate with Us

We collaborate with trusted hardware providers to ensure that users have access to reliable and high-quality infrastructure. If you’re interested in deploying your own nodes or exploring hardware options, we can connect you with our hardware provider partners. 

Additionally, we can facilitate direct communication with farmers on the ThreeFold Grid, enabling you to deploy your decentralized cloud infrastructure and engage directly with the farmers hosting your workloads. Simply reach out to us, and we’ll help you get started—whether you’re sourcing hardware, connecting with farmers, or exploring deployment options.
