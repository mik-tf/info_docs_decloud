# Growing Together: Our Commitment to Innovation

The ThreeFold Grid is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project, driven by a global community of contributors. We follow a lean and agile development process, with regular releases that bring new features, security enhancements, and performance optimizations. Our development cycle is transparent, and we actively track bugs and implement feature requests based on user feedback.

We invite you to contribute to the growth and improvement of the grid:

- **GitHub:** Submit feature requests, report bugs, or contribute code on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/threefoldtech).

- **Gitea:** For a more decentralized approach, you can also engage with us on [Gitea](https://git.ourworld.tf).

Your feedback is invaluable to us, and weâ€™re committed to building a platform that meets the evolving needs of our users. Join us in shaping the future of decentralized cloud computing!
