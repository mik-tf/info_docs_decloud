# The Need for a Change

The need for a decentralized cloud solution arises from the growing dissatisfaction with traditional cloud providers due to high costs, lack of transparency, and centralized control. Companies and individuals are seeking more control over their infrastructure, lower costs, and better performance without being locked into the monopolistic practices of hyperscalers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. The ThreeFold Grid offers a decentralized, peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure that empowers anyone to build their own cloud, reducing reliance on centralized providers and enabling true ownership of data and resources.
