# A New Paradigm: The ThreeFold Grid

The ThreeFold Grid is a decentralized cloud platform that allows anyone to deploy and manage their own cloud infrastructure. It leverages a global network of independent nodes (servers) contributed by individuals and organizations, creating a distributed and resilient cloud ecosystem. You can deploy virtual machines, storage, and networking services on the grid, with full control over your data and resources. The platform is designed to be cost-effective, scalable, and flexible, offering multiple deployment options to suit different needs.
