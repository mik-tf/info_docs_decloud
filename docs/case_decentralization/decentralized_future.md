# Building a Decentralized Future

1. **Decentralized Infrastructure:** The ThreeFold Grid is built on a peer-to-peer network of nodes, eliminating the need for centralized data centers. You can choose from multiple deployment options:

   - **Deploy on Nodes Managed by Farmers:** Utilize nodes managed by independent farmers who contribute their hardware to the grid. This option provides a hands-off approach for users who want to leverage decentralized infrastructure without managing their own hardware.

   - **Deploy on Your Own Nodes:** For those who want full control, they can become farmers themselves by managing their own nodes. This option is ideal for those who have the technical expertise and want to contribute to the grid while maintaining complete ownership of their infrastructure.

   - **Deploy on Cloud Providers:** You can also deploy nodes on cloud providers like Hetzner. This option combines the benefits of decentralized infrastructure with the convenience of cloud provider management, offering a hybrid approach for those who want to balance control and ease of use.

2. **Self-Sovereign Cloud:** You have full control over your data and applications. The grid uses blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and trust in the network.

3. **Cost Efficiency:** By leveraging underutilized hardware and decentralized resources, the ThreeFold Grid significantly reduces costs compared to traditional cloud providers. You pay only for the resources you use, with no hidden fees or vendor lock-in.

4. **Scalability:** The grid is designed to scale horizontally, allowing you to easily expand your infrastructure as your needs grow. The decentralized nature of the grid ensures high availability and resilience.

5. **Ease of Use:** The platform provides a user-friendly interface and APIs for deploying and managing cloud resources. You can deploy virtual machines, storage, and networking services with just a few clicks or commands.
