# Decentralizing the Cloud

## The Problem with Today's Cloud

The internet as we know it is broken. Centralized cloud providers dominate the landscape, charging exorbitant fees, locking users into proprietary ecosystems, and controlling the flow of data. The result? A system that prioritizes profit over people, stifles innovation, and leaves users vulnerable to outages, data breaches, and censorship.

## A New Way Forward

The ThreeFold Grid offers a radical alternative to centralized cloud: a decentralized, peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure that puts power back in the hands of users, sysadmins, developers and entrepreneurs. Built on a global network of independent nodes, the ThreeFold Grid enables anyone to deploy their own decentralized cloud—one that is open, resilient, and truly owned by you. Whether you’re a developer, a startup, or an enterprise, the ThreeFold Grid gives you the tools to take control of your infrastructure, reduce costs, and contribute to a more equitable digital future.
