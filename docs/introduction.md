# Introduction

## The Problem with Today's Cloud

The internet as we know it is broken. Centralized cloud providers dominate the landscape, charging exorbitant fees, locking users into proprietary ecosystems, and controlling the flow of data. The result? A system that prioritizes profit over people, stifles innovation, and leaves users vulnerable to outages, data breaches, and censorship.

The ThreeFold Grid offers a radical alternative to centralized cloud: a decentralized, peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure that puts power back in the hands of users. Built on a global network of independent nodes, the ThreeFold Grid enables anyone to deploy their own decentralized cloud—one that is open, resilient, and truly owned by its users. Whether you’re a developer, a startup, or an enterprise, the ThreeFold Grid gives you the tools to take control of your infrastructure, reduce costs, and contribute to a more equitable digital future.

## The Case for Decentralization

### The Need for a Change

The need for a decentralized cloud solution arises from the growing dissatisfaction with traditional cloud providers due to high costs, lack of transparency, and centralized control. Companies and individuals are seeking more control over their infrastructure, lower costs, and better performance without being locked into the monopolistic practices of hyperscalers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. The ThreeFold Grid offers a decentralized, peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure that empowers users to build their own cloud, reducing reliance on centralized providers and enabling true ownership of data and resources.

### A New Paradigm: The ThreeFold Grid

The ThreeFold Grid is a decentralized cloud platform that allows users to deploy and manage their own cloud infrastructure. It leverages a global network of independent nodes (servers) contributed by individuals and organizations, creating a distributed and resilient cloud ecosystem. Users can deploy virtual machines, storage, and networking services on the grid, with full control over their data and resources. The platform is designed to be cost-effective, scalable, and flexible, offering multiple deployment options to suit different needs.

### Building a Decentralized Future

1. Decentralized Infrastructure: The ThreeFold Grid is built on a peer-to-peer network of nodes, eliminating the need for centralized data centers. Users can choose from multiple deployment options:

- Deploy on Nodes Managed by Farmers: Utilize nodes managed by independent farmers who contribute their hardware to the grid. This option provides a hands-off approach for users who want to leverage decentralized infrastructure without managing their own hardware.

- Deploy on Your Own Nodes: For users who want full control, they can become farmers themselves by managing their own nodes. This option is ideal for those who have the technical expertise and want to contribute to the grid while maintaining complete ownership of their infrastructure.

- Deploy on Cloud Providers: Users can also deploy nodes on cloud providers like Hetzner. This option combines the benefits of decentralized infrastructure with the convenience of cloud provider management, offering a hybrid approach for those who want to balance control and ease of use.

2. Self-Sovereign Cloud: Users have full control over their data and applications. The grid uses blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and trust in the network.

3. Cost Efficiency: By leveraging underutilized hardware and decentralized resources, the ThreeFold Grid significantly reduces costs compared to traditional cloud providers. Users pay only for the resources they use, with no hidden fees or vendor lock-in.

4. Scalability: The grid is designed to scale horizontally, allowing users to easily expand their infrastructure as their needs grow. The decentralized nature of the grid ensures high availability and resilience.

5. Ease of Use: The platform provides a user-friendly interface and APIs for deploying and managing cloud resources. Users can deploy virtual machines, storage, and networking services with just a few clicks or commands.
